## JVMRally Rules

1. JVMRally is a place primarily for developers to discuss JVM languages, features, and development. There are a few topics that always drive people into more aggressive or uncomfortable arguments. Adhere to the following content policy. If you wish to discuss the these topics, find another server.
    - No discussion of topics related to Religion or Politics
    - No discussion of porn and other similar nsfw content.
    - No discussion of topics related to Anime
        - This ban applies to “weeb”-talk, such as: Kawaii, baka, neko, waifu, nani, etc.
        - This ban applies to odd action-talk such as “*blushes*” or “*looks over at you*”, JVMRally isn’t the place.
    - No discussion of suicide or depression. We are software developers not therapists. If you wish to talk to people about it keep it in private conversation or talk to a professional http://www.suicide.org/international-suicide-hotlines.html 
    - No discussions of illicit topics or topics that go against the discord Terms of Service https://discordapp.com/terms
    - No discussion of bans, kicks, warnings, or mutings. If you have an issue, private message `@Lambda#0313`

2. Racism, bigotry, sexism, hate-speech or otherwise will not be tolerated.
    - The golden rule of the server is to act like you would at work, as an actual professional. There will be no warnings for this rule, you will just be banned.

3. No X is better than Y opinion fights. These are not useful discussions. This is not to say you cannot discuss an opinion or argue a point, but the age-old classics listed above have been beaten to death N+1 too many times. This includes but is not limited to:
    - Light vs dark themes
    - Tabs vs spaces
    - IDE x vs IDE y vs Code Editor Z
    - Programming language X vs Y

4. Be professional
    - You don’t have to love each other, you don’t even have to tolerate each other (block function exists) but above all, just be professional and courteous as you would at a real job. This server is aimed to be slightly above entry-level /hobbyist programmer, and much more fixated on the actual career of Software Engineering.
    
5. Be inclusive
    - As a community, our goal is to learn, and grow. If someone does not know as much as you in a particular topic, help them out - people have expertise and skills in other areas, and although the server is aimed at being towards a more professional crowd, that doesn’t mean everyone is a subject matter expert in whatever technology you are talking about at the current moment.
    
6. No advertisements that directly benefit you. If you have doubts, private message `@Lambda#0313`. This includes but is not limited to:
    - YouTube channels
    - Online courses you sell
    - Websites you own
    - Affiliate links
    - Job postings
    - Hiring requests
    
7. Code talks, bullshit walks
    - Instead of having a shit-flinging match over beliefs, write code to prove what you’re saying and showcase it. Actual verifiable and reproducible results is much more of a debate ender than who can come up with the most creative insults and fallacy usage.
    
8. Listen to the staff. If they tell you to do something, do it.
